# Common patterns which I have used but could be improved



I have been using:

  grep ... <something> ... >/dev/null

to test for the presence of <something> without creating any output if it is present.  However it might be better to do:

  grep ... -q <something> ...

Or we could even write a script for it:

  contains_regexp <something> ...
