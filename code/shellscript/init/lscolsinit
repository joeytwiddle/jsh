# Load pretty colors for ls into the shell.  This script should be sourced:
#
#     . lscolsinit
#
# If you have previously created the file `~/.lscols` (e.g. by running
# lscolsrefresh) then this script will load that file, which is fast.
#
# Otherwise this script will run `dircolors` to generate the variable, which is
# slower, but always up-to-date.
#
# In the case when `~/.lscols` exists, if you update `~/.dircolors` then you
# should rerun `lscolsrefresh` and `. lscolsinit`

# dircolors wants this

# TODO: We could be clever and do lscolsrefresh if we detect a .`dircolors` newer
# than `.lscols`.  But that doesn't seem like the fastest solution.
