## TODO: maybe this should be renamed to jshaliases
## aliases are worth keeping in one place because they are so fundamental to the user's shell that
## they should be easy to find if they prove troublesome
## new jsh users should be warned about shell aliases
## which or something nicer like whatis (ah that's already taken) should info of aliases before informing about cmd-line programs

# Note: other aliases are initialised in dirhistorysetup

test "$COLUMNS" && export COLUMNS

	alias ls="ls -atrFb$XARGS --time-style=long-iso"
elif test $JM_DOES_COLOUR; then
	alias ls='fakels'
else
	alias ls='ls -atrF'

# alias l='ls -l'
## superceded by the l shellscript:
alias l='. l'
alias dl='ls -ld'

alias tail=prettytail

## Note: it's rather important that aliases don't get passed
## down to child shells / processes, because this would likely
## result in infinite loops.
### Er, I think that might be the default anyway!

# alias jhelp="$JPATH/tools/help" ## Because bash went and used it!
# alias help='jhelp' ## Hehe I stole it back! (U can still type 'help' for bash's)
## Hmm, seems rude, so leaving help as it was.

## Because it's nice for the user, but overriding is bad for scripts:
# alias apropos=japropos
alias apropos='NOPROGRESS=true catch japropos'

## We should do this for everything (no reason why not to, apart from memo diskspace usage I guess):
# alias dusk="rememo dusk"
# alias dusk="memo -c true dusk"
# alias dusk="memo -t '1 minute' dusk"
alias dusk="memo -t '1 hour' dusk"

# alias wget='screen wget'

## Shellscripts in their own right, but oneliners: (could make functions)

alias quiet='fadevolume 0'

alias memo='memo -info'

## (Intended) for user only:
alias mv='mv -i'
## -a is nice, it will copy directories recursively; -i because i don't want to overwrite stuff by accident
alias cp='cp -a -i'

alias cal='cal | highlight "\<`date | takecols 3`\>"'

alias h='hist .'
