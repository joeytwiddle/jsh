Processes ~/.dircolors to create or update the ~/.lscols cachefile for lscolsinit.  This makes lscols load faster when you start a shell session.

Example usage:

vim ~/.dircolors
lscolsrefresh
. lscolsinit

!
exit 0
fi

FILE="$HOME/.dircolors"
# If they don't already have a colour scheme
if [ ! -f "$FILE" ]
then
	# Try using Joey's setting
	if [ -f "$JPATH/code/home/.dircolors" ]
	then
		FILE="$JPATH/code/home/.dircolors"
	# Otherwise generate default
	else
		echo "I am generating default ls colour settings in $FILE"
		echo "Change it if you want funkier colours."
		dircolors -p > "$FILE"
	fi
fi
dircolors "$FILE" > "$HOME/.lscols"

## My zsh needs this version because I was trying out the no-clobber option.  But this breaks in bash (in fact it writes to a file called ! and then barfs on the redundant .lscols argument).
# dircolors "$FILE" >! "$HOME/.lscols"
## It's moot anyway, in its current form .dircolors does nothing!
## If we really need this, we could just rm -f the file first.
