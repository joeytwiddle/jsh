## See also: Modern grep has --colour=auto, which only invokes when the output
## is to terminal(tty/pts) (not piped).
##
## This might make higrep redundant.  However I am still using it on those
## occasions when the output IS piped but I still want it highlighted.  So
## let's never fix that 'not checking tty bug' in higrep.  ;)

## BUG TODO: Exit code does not perform like grep

## TODO: Should process -i and set highlight correctly (maybe using caseinsensitiveregexp)

## Recommended usage:
## higrep <grepstring> [ <grepopts> ... ] [ <grepfiles> ... ]
## -E to grep will not be passed to sed, but sed does regex (although there are some differences)

# jsh-ext-depends: sed
# jsh-depends: curseblue highlight cursenorm countargs cursebold cursecyan

## DONE: Detect if we are outputting to pts or to another pipe, and decide
## whether to add highlight colors or not.
# if isatty
# then doHighlight=1
# else doHighlight=""
# fi
## Sod that.  higrep is explicit, and I want to use it with 'more'!
doHighlight=1

then cat << !

higrep <regexp> [ <grep_options> ]* [ <files> ]*

  Like grep, but highlights occurrences of the regexp in a random colour.

  Note: highlight uses sed so your <regexp> should be grep and sed compatible.

  If multiple arguments are given, it also attempts highlighting of filenames
  in a multi-file search, and context regions in a context grep.

  BUG TODO: higrep does not always return the correct exit value (=grep's).
        Can this simply be solved with a "grep ." at the end of the |s?

## The stderr pipe is not vital, but grep * often give annoying directory errors which I want to ignore.  TODO: isn't there is an option to ignore just them so we can keep other errors?  DONE

		## If no filenames were generated, the - may be matched in the text; breaking proper highlighting matches; this avoids line starting with whitespace; but really we should determine whether filenames are expected or not:
