## This method wasn't entirely accurate; sometimes you can have a DISPLAY variable but that display cannot be reached.
# [ ! "$DISPLAY" = "" ]

## This method checks whether the display can actually be reached:
jshinfo "xisrunning: testing xterm method"
unj xterm -e touch /tmp/xisrunning."$$" 2>/dev/null
[ -f /tmp/xisrunning."$$" ] ; RESULT="$?"
rm -f /tmp/xisrunning."$$"
exit "$RESULT"
# rm /tmp/xisrunning."$$" ## I thought this might give an exit code representing whether the file existed, but it didn't.
