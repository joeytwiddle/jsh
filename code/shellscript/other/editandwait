## Convenience function for user: if they gave a remote folder instead of the
## local one, then we move to that folder, which may make it easier to open
## related files from the editor later.  Only implemented at the moment for
## global paths, since otherwise we would need to rewrite "$1".  (In fact, as
## it is, this will break opening of any later args which are given as relative
## paths rather than global!)  OK fixed that by only acting if only 1 arg.
