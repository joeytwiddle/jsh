# jsh-ext-depends: sed column

## TODO: to make it more useful for formatting code from within vim, have it (optionally/by default?) detect if text block is indented, and preserve that indent after formatting columns.

if [ "$1" = -on ]
then
	ON="$2"
	shift; shift
else
	ON=" 	"
fi

# echo "ON=$ON"

## Unsupported as yet, but should prevent alignment of columns beyond # $UPTO
if [ "$1" = -upto ]
then
	UPTO="$2"
	shift; shift
fi

# column -t -s '	 ' "$@"
# -x ?
# column -t -s ' ' "$@"

column -t -s "$ON" "$@" |
## Turns column spacing of "  " into " " or $ON:
# sed 's+  \([^ ]\)+ \1+g' ## remove one space from each sequence of spaces encountered
cat
# if [ "$ON" ]
# then sed "s+  \([^ ]\)+$ON\1+g"
# else sed 's+  \([^ ]\)+ \1+g'

## Undo columnisation on all fields > 3:
MATCH_COLUMN="[^ ]*\( *\)"
LEAVE_ALONE="\1"
SQUEEZE=" "

## Can't think of a way to implement squeezing of earlier columns
## unless we turn em into eg. _s then back
