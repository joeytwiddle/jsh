swap <fileA> <fileB>

  Swaps the two files on disk (via an intermediary ./tmp.swp)

  This does not fail if one of the files is non-existent.  Hence it can be used
  to move a file somewhere else temporarily, and then move it back using the
  same command.  (Although it doesn't look pretty doing it!)

  So instead of:

    mv suspect suspect.disabled
    # test something
    mv suspect.disabled suspect

  You can save your fingers with:

    swap suspect suspect.disabled
    # test something
    swap suspect suspect.disabled     (<Up>+<Enter>)

verbosely mv "$1" tmp.swp
if [ -e "$1" ]; then
  echo "Tried moving $1 to tmp.swp but it's still there!"
  exit 1
fi
verbosely mv "$2" "$1"
if [ -e "$2" ]; then
  echo "Tried moving $2 to $1 but it's still there!"
  echo "$1 is now in tmp.swp"
  exit 1
fi
verbosely mv tmp.swp "$2"
echo "$1 <-> $2"
