<joeytwiddle> Person A creates a "view session" which he splits into two panes. In one pane he creates a "work session" and in the other pane he attaches to the Person B's "work session". Similarly, Person B creates a work session and a view session, and attaches to Person A's work session.
<joeytwiddle> Each person can work in their own session, and see what the other person is doing. There are 4 tmux sessions in total: 2 work, 2 view.
<joeytwiddle> Person A does this: tmux new-session | tmux new-session -s adam_working | <Ctrl-B> " | tmux attach -t eve_working | <Ctrl-B> o
<joeytwiddle> And Person B does something similar. One disadvantage is that you have nested tmuxes, so you need to double up the prefix when you want to send a command to your work session.

Note that this cannot be done with separate user accounts.  All commands must be done using the same user account.

We will create 4 tmux sessions, two working sessions and two view sessions.  Each view session will be split into two panes, so that it can display the work sessions of both people.

Each person can work in their work session, but view the other person's work session at the same time.

# Person Adam

    tmux new-session -s adam_view
    TMUX= tmux new-session -s adam_working
    ....
    <Ctrl-B> "
    tmux attach -r -t eve_working
    <Ctrl-B> o

# Person Eve

    tmux new-session -s eve_view
    TMUX= tmux new-session -s eve_working
    ....
    <Ctrl-B> "
    tmux attach -r -t adam_working
    <Ctrl-B> o

# Explained

Create a new view session.  (Naming the terminal with `-s` is optional, but we do it for clarity.)

    tmux new-session -s eve_view

Inside that view sessionm, create a new work session.  (We must empty the `TMUX` variable to allow this.)

    TMUX= tmux new-session -s eve_working

Wait for the other person to also create their work session.

    ....

Split your view session.  (If you prefer a horizontal split, use `<Ctrl-B> %`.)

    <Ctrl-B> "

In the new pane, open the other person's work session read-only, so you can see it but you can't interrupt the other person.

    tmux attach -r -t adam_working

Switch back to your work pane.

    <Ctrl-B> o

# Additional

Here are some things you can do to make working smoother.

Change the prefix of the outer (view) tmux to `<Ctrl-P>`, so you can use your normal prefix `<Ctrl-B>` to reach the inner (working) tmux.

    <Ctrl-B>:set-window-option prefix C-p
