# My dirhistory tool
# You need to source this in your ~/.<mysh>rc

# For zsh:
# Uses `s instead of source and export
# Does not support searching 'cos I can't pass the argument!

# I suspect this does not work, for bash or for zsh.  In reality, we use dirhistorysetup.zsh, which works in both shells!
