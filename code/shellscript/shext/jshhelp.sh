## TODO: shellscripts will be able to call this
## this performs the common operation of showing help if "--help" is the first argument, and exiting.

## The input could be piped to jshhelp, or provided as an argument, or might be found in a special format in the calling script.

## Alternatively to scripts having to call jshhelp, some hook could be put in the shell, so that when the user does run a command with "--help", the command would be redirected to displaying the help.
## (Such a mechanism could also detect calls to "man".)
