## I had a wav from TeamSpeak at 22050Hz
## To prepare it for bladeenc, I first had to:
## sox blah.wav -r 48000 blah2.wav

if test "$1" = "" -o "$2" = "" ; then
  echo "wav2mp3 <wav input filename> <mp3 output filename>"
  exit 1
fi

bladeenc -QUIT "$1"

## BUG TODO: output is only tmp.mp3 if input was tmp.wav :P
mv "tmp.mp3" "$2"
