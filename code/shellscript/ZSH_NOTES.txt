 Event Designators
     An  event designator is a reference to a command-line entry in the his‐
     tory list.  In the list below, remember that the initial  `!'  in  each
     item  may  be  changed  to  another  character by setting the histchars
     parameter.

     !      Start a history expansion, except when followed by a blank, new‐
            line,  `=' or `('.  If followed immediately by a word designator
            (see the section `Word Designators'), this forms a history  ref‐
            erence with no event designator (see the section `Overview').

     !!     Refer  to  the  previous  command.   By  itself,  this expansion
            repeats the previous command.

     !n     Refer to command-line n.

     !-n    Refer to the current command-line minus n.

     !str   Refer to the most recent command starting with str.

     !?str[?]
            Refer to the most recent command containing str.   The  trailing
            `?'  is necessary if this reference is to be followed by a modi‐
            fier or followed by any text that is not to be  considered  part
            of str.

     !#     Refer  to the current command line typed in so far.  The line is
            treated as if it were complete up  to  and  including  the  word
            before the one with the `!#' reference.

     !{...} Insulate a history reference from adjacent characters (if neces‐
            sary).

 Word Designators
     A word designator indicates which word or words of a given command line
     are to be included in a history reference.  A `:' usually separates the
     event specification from the word designator.  It may be  omitted  only
     if  the  word designator begins with a `^', `$', `*', `-' or `%'.  Word
     designators include:

     0      The first input word (command).
     n      The nth argument.
     ^      The first argument.  That is, 1.
     $      The last argument.
     %      The word matched by (the most recent) ?str search.
     x-y    A range of words; x defaults to 0.
     *      All the arguments, or a null value if there are none.
     x*     Abbreviates `x-$'.
     x-     Like `x*' but omitting word $.

     Note that a `%' word designator works only when used in  one  of  `!%',
     `!:%'  or `!?str?:%', and only when used after a !? expansion (possibly
     in an earlier command).  Anything else results in  an  error,  although
     the error may not be the most obvious one.
