# Escalation of unwanted programs

Ideally sudo would come with two options:

- After `sudo`, further calls to `sudo` from this user shell would be auto-accepted for 15 minutes.

- After `sudo -c`, also calls from child shells would also be auto-accepted.

Currently sudo only supports the first behaviour.  As a result, if we need to do a simple command in sudo, e.g.

    user@local$ sudo ln -s $PWD/atool /usr/local/bin/

Then we might do something which we think is not risky:

    user@local$ atool --help

But if `atool` is malicious, it can gain jump from user privileges to gain root privileges!


# The sudoers file

Hard to understand.

Man page looks like it's creating regexps, but actually globs are being used.

Man page offers examples which can be broken to e.g. change root's password!

Very difficult to create safe whitelist / blacklist.
