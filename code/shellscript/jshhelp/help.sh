* About the jsh system *

jsh has two main components:

  1) Shell setup (for bash/zsh)
  2) Shell tools

1) Shell setup
    You have a number of new aliases, a pretty coloured prompt, environment
    variables to enhance common programs (eg. coloured ls listings), and handy
    keybindings for your shell.

2) Shell tools
    jsh adds \$JPATH/tools to your \$PATH, which contains symlinks to a number
    of useful shellscripts.
    'jdoc <toolname>' documents each of these shellscripts
