jsh needs to be broken into sensible modules
it is bloated because it loads everything and repeats other things
need to think about:
- which scripts need what sort of config?
- are they run a lot (should their config be loaded into user shell env, or
  should the scripts load it at runtime?)

Desired features:
- User can choose which scripts to install / use / ignore.
- Dependencies are checked (for other scripts or system packages, or something in the PATH at least)
- Configuration happens in the correct place, and user knows how to alter it.
