## TODO: could allow option to force override of the 15min check
##       No, it's dangerous if cron runs < 15mins and it's not difficult to allow file access (/tmp!)

LAST=/tmp/ppp-updateip.last

IP=`ppp-getip`

## This bit is a check to ensure we didn't already do an update with this IP
## Note: If an update fails, the IP address is not recorded as update =) but if you add an update and re-run it will skip.
## Ideally we would like other puters on the net to tell us when our ip is wrong.  (By connecting to them and asking them presumably.)

LASTIP=`cat "$LAST"`

## This bit is a check to ensure we didn't update already in the last 15 minutes.

## If the file ain't there, we assume we haven't updated for 15minutes.
## Maybe instead we should assume it has.  If we touch LAST and exit, the update could then occur in 15mins time.
## A bit annoying for a fresh boot though.  Alternatively we could keep the file somewhere outside /tmp.

		echo "$0: Trying to re-update too soon.  ($X < 16m ago.)"

## OK so let's do the update

## Make the "lock".  Repeated at bottom =)
