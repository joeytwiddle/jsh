# jsh-depends: jwatch psforwatch jwatchcomp
## Watches ps output for processes starting/stopping
## Quite useful, but note that very fast processes are
## not noticed if they start and stop inbetween two
## successive poles of ps.

## TODO: If other jwatches are running to monitor other things, monitorps will
## observe their processes.  This can be distracting, so we should try to
## prevent it.  We could ungrep 'jwatch' at least, or possible get jwatch to
## provide us a parent-process list which we can ungrep.
